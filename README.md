# Rust Boids
Boids (Bird-oid Objects) are illustrative of emergent behaviour of systems through encoding simple rules on single agents. This project was created to get familiar with rust, boids and graphics within rust using Bevy. For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids

## Running the boids
To run the simulation you simply need to issue:

```zsh
# while in the root folder of the project
cargo run --release
```
